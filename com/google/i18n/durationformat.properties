# This file contains the information required for proper formatting of 
# durations. It contains locale specific data, but we don't have enough
# data at the moment to warrant a resource bundle structure tree.
# There are two types of information in this property file:
# locale.spacer is the element that is inserted between duration elements
# locale.repeatAfter20 is the element tells us whether numbers after 20
# start to repeat from singular (common in Slavic languages)

# spacer strings
# defaults in DurationFormatterFactory.java to " "
zh.spacer=

#repeat after 20 strings
# defaults in DurationFormatterFactory.java to no
ru.repeatAfter20=yes
sr.repeatAfter20=yes
